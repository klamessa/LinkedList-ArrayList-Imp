**About:**
This repository contains Java implementations of data structures: LinkedList and ArrayList. Each data structure is implemented as a separate class.

**LinkedList:**
The LinkedList class is designed to provide a generic linked list data structure. It offers various operations for adding, removing, sorting, and manipulating elements within the list.

**Features:**
Add elements to the end or at a specific index.
Clear the list.
Retrieve elements by index.
Find the first index of a specific element.
Check if the list is empty.
Get the number of elements in the list.
Sort the list in ascending order.
Remove elements by index or filter elements to keep only those equal to a specified value.
Reverse the order of elements.
Merge two sorted linked lists.
Swap adjacent pairs of elements.
ArrayList (Merged with LinkedList)
In addition to the LinkedList class, this repository also includes the ArrayList class, which implements similar data structure functionality but using an array-based approach.

**Features: (ArrayList)**
Add elements to the end or at a specific index.
Clear the list.
Retrieve elements by index.
Find the first index of a specific element.
Check if the list is empty.
Get the number of elements in the list.
Sort the list in ascending order.
Remove elements by index or filter elements to keep only those equal to a specified value.
Reverse the order of elements.

**Getting Started:**
You can use these data structures in your Java projects by including the respective class files (LinkedList.java and ArrayList.java) in your project directory. Make sure to adjust the package structure as needed.

**Usage Examples:**
In the main method of each class, you'll find usage examples demonstrating how to create and work with the respective data structures. These examples can serve as a starting point for your own implementations.
